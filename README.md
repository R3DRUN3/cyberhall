# 🛡️ 🌐 🥷🏻 CYBERHALL 🏴‍☠️ 👾 🕵🏾

## Abstract 
This repository collects notes, walkthroughs and proof of concepts <br/> for everything related to the world of cybersecurity, especially CTF (Capture The Flag).<br/><br/>
I strongly believe that the best way to learn InfoSec and SecOps <br/> is to get your hands dirty and hit your head repeatedly and violently against it 😄
